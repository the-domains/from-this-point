I first encountered 3289 (as far as I can remember), late in 1997

After more than twenty years in the automotive parts business, I changed careers for physical and mental health reasons. I took my Journalism degree, inventory expertise, and some self acquired personal and business computer experience into the marketplace ... and procured a position at Microsoft, in Redmond, WA

With a massive amount of planning, I was ultimately in the right place, at the right moment, to become a contracted BVT Tester, in the Windows 98 Build Lab, located in Building 10 on the Redmond Microsoft campus.

The Build Lab was a large, dim, cold room, full of computers, and 10 to 12 "lab rats" at any one time.

We were charged with building and Build Variance Testing, the daily version of the DOS based Windows product; Windows 98, and beyond (well, at least two more iterations beyond).

The number on the door was, 3289

Act II ... before moving to California in 2006, I went to the AT&T store to get my first iPhone. The 916 area code number seemed familiar; 3489 (okay, not on the money, but really close).

Act III ... last year (2015), I had some difficulty signing up as a Founder for "the grid"

This is not another do-it-yourself website builder. The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. As your needs grow, it evolves with you, effortlessly adapting to your needs. Want to add e-commerce? Social feeds? A different layout? The Grid just takes care of it. This is not a website builder. This is your personal AI web developer. Its first masterpiece is the website you're looking at right now. Its next one could be yours.

On the fourth attempt, over two days, it finally accepted me, and issued a number: \*3289

Coincidence? I think not.

... just a few other appearances of 3289

U.S. Code ยง 3289

Whenever an indictment or information charging a felony is dismissed for any reason before the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations has expired, and such period will expire within six calendar months of the date of the dismissal of the indictment or information, a new indictment may be returned in the appropriate jurisdiction within six calendar months of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, or, in the event of an appeal, within 60 days of the date the dismissal of the indictment or information becomes final, or, if no regular grand jury is in session in the appropriate jurisdiction at the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, within six calendar months of the date when the next regular grand jury is convened, which new indictment shall not be barred by any statute of limitations. This section does not permit the filing of a new indictment or information where the reason for the dismissal was the failure to file the indictment or information within the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations, or some other reason that would bar a new prosecution.

Department of Interior Secretarial Order 3289

In signing Secretarial Order No. 3289 on Sept. 14, 2009, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar directed Department of the Interior bureaus to stimulate the development of the LCC network as a response to landscape-scale stressors, including climate change.
